# INTRO_TO_IM
This is a repository for my Introduction to IM Class. It contains my blogs and class work for the course. 
The course description is copied and pasted below:
"With the advent of digital computation, humans have found a variety of new tools for self-expression and communication. Thinking about how we interface with these tools beyond the mouse and key-board, we can approach software and electronics as artists and designers, exploring new interactions with machines and each other. This introductory course will provide students hands-on experience with screen and physical interaction design through programming and electronics using microcontrollers, electronics, and software development. Weekly exercises encourage students to experiment freely, creating their own novel interfaces and controls for working with machines. The course culminates with a final projects exhibited at the programâ€™s end-of-semester showcase."
This class is taught by Prof.Michael Shiloh.
